### **Question 1: Equation of Tangent Line**
**Problem:**  
Determine the equation of the straight-line tangent to \( y = \cos(\sin(x)) \) at the intersection point with \( x = 5 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Find the point of tangency:**  
   Evaluate \( y \) at \( x = 5 \):  
   \[
   y(5) = \cos(\sin(5))
   \]

2. **Find the derivative of \( y \):**  
   The derivative of \( y = \cos(\sin(x)) \) is:  
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dx} = -\sin(\sin(x)) \cdot \cos(x)
   \]

3. **Evaluate the derivative at \( x = 5 \):**  
   \[
   m = \frac{dy}{dx}\bigg|_{x=5} = -\sin(\sin(5)) \cdot \cos(5)
   \]

4. **Write the equation of the tangent line:**  
   Use the point-slope form:  
   \[
   y - y(5) = m(x - 5)
   \]
   Substituting \( y(5) \) and \( m \):  
   \[
   y - \cos(\sin(5)) = -\sin(\sin(5)) \cdot \cos(5) \cdot (x - 5)
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
The equation of the tangent line is:  
\[
y = -\sin(\sin(5)) \cdot \cos(5) \cdot (x - 5) + \cos(\sin(5))
\]

### **Question 2: Minimum Number of Flips**
**Problem:**  
A set of numbers containing the natural numbers 1 to 100 are arranged in ascending order except for ten numbers which were misplaced. A "flip" operation switches the places of two adjacent numbers. What is the minimum number of flips required to restore the order?

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding the problem:**  
   The numbers 1 to 100 are mostly in order, except for 10 misplaced numbers. A "flip" operation swaps two adjacent numbers.

2. **Key insight:**  
   The minimum number of flips required to sort a sequence is equal to the number of inversions in the sequence. An inversion is a pair of numbers where a larger number precedes a smaller number.

3. **Calculate the number of inversions:**  
   Since 10 numbers are misplaced, the maximum number of inversions occurs when these 10 numbers form a single cycle. The number of flips required to sort a cycle of length \( n \) is \( n - 1 \).

4. **Conclusion:**  
   The minimum number of flips required is \( 10 - 1 = 9 \).

**Final Answer:**  
The minimum number of flips required is **9**.

   \]

2. **Substitute \( n = 50 \):**  
   \[

   \]

**Final Answer (a):**  
\[
50!
\]

#### **Part (b):**

   \]

   \[
   \frac{dy}{du} = \cos(u) = \cos(\ln x)
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{du}{dx} = \frac{1}{x}
   \]

3. **Combine results:**  
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx} \sin(\ln x) = \cos(\ln x) \cdot \frac{1}{x} = \frac{\cos(\ln x)}{x}
   \]

**Final Answer (a):**  
\[
\frac{\cos(\ln x)}{x}
\]

#### **Part (b):**

   The derivative of \( \log_x a \) is:  
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx} \log_x a = \frac{d}{dx} \frac{\ln a}{\ln x}
   \]

2. **Compute the derivative:**  
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx} \frac{\ln a}{\ln x} = \frac{-\ln a}{x (\ln x)^2}
   \]

**Final Answer (b):**  
\[
-\frac{\ln a}{x (\ln x)^2}
\]

   \[
   \sin \theta + \sin 4\theta = 2 \sin\left(\frac{5\theta}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{3\theta}{2}\right)
   \]  
   \[
   \sin 2\theta + \sin 3\theta = 2 \sin\left(\frac{5\theta}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
   \]

3. **Set the two expressions equal:**  
   \[
   2 \sin\left(\frac{5\theta}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{3\theta}{2}\right) = 2 \sin\left(\frac{5\theta}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
   \]

4. **Simplify:**  
   \[
   \cos\left(\frac{3\theta}{2}\right) = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
   \]

5. **Solve for \( \theta \):**  
   \[
   \frac{3\theta}{2} = \pm \frac{\theta}{2} + 2\pi n
   \]

6. **Find solutions in \( -\pi \leq \theta \leq \pi \):**  
   The solutions are:  
   \[
   \theta = -\pi, -\frac{2\pi}{5}, -\frac{\pi}{5}, 0, \frac{\pi}{5}, \frac{2\pi}{5}, \pi
