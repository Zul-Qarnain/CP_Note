Below is a practical, Bangladesh-specific snapshot of what you can expect when you open and operate a bKash Merchant Account in mid-2025.


---

1  | Daily / Monthly transaction capacity

What you want to do	Current ceiling*	Where the limit really comes from

Receive customer payments	No hard cap for merchants – you can accept as many individual payments as you like. (The customer still has a per-payment ceiling of Tk 50 000, a daily cap of Tk 50 000 and a monthly cap of Tk 3 lakh on their wallet, so that is the practical maximum you will see in a single hit.)	Bangladesh Bank MFS circular, Mar 2025
Maximum balance you may keep in the wallet at any point	Tk 5 lakh	Bangladesh Bank limit applied to all MFS wallets
Settle (transfer) your takings to a bank account	Tk 50 000 each transfer • up to 50 transfers/day • up to Tk 3 lakh/month	bKash to-Bank product limits
Cash-out over the counter/ATM (if you really need cash)	Tk 30 000/day • Tk 2 lakh/month; fee 1.85 % via agents or BDT 14.90/ k at designated ATMs	bKash fee schedule


*bKash occasionally tweaks limits after Bangladesh Bank circulars; check the bKash app “Help › Limits” page for the live figure before a major campaign.

2  | Documents you must supply to open the account

bKash’s online / in-branch form will ask for:

National ID (NID) or Passport/Driving Licence – scanned copy and e-KYC verification.

Valid Trade Licence for the shop or company (with expiry date).

Active bank account (any scheduled bank) for settlement; bKash will ask for a void cheque or bank-letter.

e-TIN / Tax Identification Number – optional for micro-merchants but recommended so you can claim input tax later.

Contact details (mobile that will hold the wallet, e-mail, shop address) and two passport photos (for sole proprietors).


Once the e-KYC is cleared you get an SMS; activation takes ~ 4 working days.

3  | What it costs – bKash fees plus government taxes

Charge	Who keeps it?	Standard rate

Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) – deducted each time a customer pays you	bKash	1.6 % is the regulatory floor for regular Bangla QR merchants; large chains negotiate 1.0 – 1.5 %.
bKash → Bank settlement fee	bKash	1.00 % (Agrani/Sonali) to 1.25 % at other banks.
VAT on every bKash service fee	National Board of Revenue	15 % of the fee (bKash withholds and remits automatically).


There is no one-time “account opening” or “maintenance” fee.

Quick cost example

Customer pays Tk 1 000 for a product:

Gross sale                              Tk   1 000.00
– MDR 1.6 % (bKash)                         –16.00
– VAT 15 % on that fee (NBR)                 –2.40
Net amount instantly visible               Tk   981.60

If you sweep that Tk 981.60 to your bank the same day at 1.25 %, another Tk 12.27 (plus Tk 1.84 VAT) is deducted en-route.

4  | Other tax obligations outside bKash

Tax	When it bites	Threshold / rate	Key source

Turnover Tax (if not VAT-registered)	Monthly VAT return	3 % of turnover if annual sales are Tk 30 lakh – 50 lakh	NBR guideline
VAT (full)	Monthly VAT return	15 %* once annual turnover exceeds Tk 50 lakh	NBR guideline
Income Tax	Annual return (July–Sep)	22.5 % – 32.5 % company rate; progressive slabs for sole proprietors	Income-Tax Act 2023


*You charge VAT to your customers (if applicable) and can credit the VAT bKash withheld on the MDR.

5  | Bottom line

Transaction capacity: practically unlimited on the incoming side; Bangladesh Bank caps mainly affect customers, not merchants.

Paperwork: NID + Trade Licence + Bank account are the non-negotiables; e-TIN is strongly recommended.

Cost per sale: plan for ≈ 1.6 % + 15 % VAT (= 1.84 %) out of each receipt; add up to 1.25 % + VAT if you sweep funds to your bank the same day.

Government taxes beyond bKash: standard VAT / turnover tax and income-tax rules apply once your business crosses the NBR thresholds.


That’s everything you need to budget, file and stay compliant with a bKash Merchant Account in 2025. Good luck growing those digital sales!
